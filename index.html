            After the world suffered from utter chaos following the unification of the 7 realms by the Elders, many lost
            the will to live, existence itself was dreadful. But this dread did not come from the destruction and
            cleansing that followed the unification rather from the instinct to refuse change deep inside every sentient
            being, to eat and drink with the same monsters that slayed your brethren and to see them eye to eye was
            something impossible. After his revival ; Vision, fed up by the atrocities of the Elders who claimed
            themselves messengers of God, set out to end misery and suffering once and for all whatever it cost.
            <br>
            It is said the dragon slayer, bringer of chaos got his title following his revival at the altar of solitude,
            soon
            after his revival the world crumbled and burnt, while many considered the revival of Vision to be a bad omen
            the heavens had something different reserved in fate, the dragon slayer was reborn after being slain by one
            of the Elder but this time in his true meta-physical body.
